# These are just some ideas i had and nowhere final

## Changes
* Add a Carry System (possibly)
* Create a Hypixel Guild (Requirements: Use DG, Catacombs 28+, Skill Average 35+)

## Reasoning
* We currently can not apply for  Discord Partner due to being a Mod related Discord. This would change it and allow us to become a Discord Partner.
* This would also boost the activity due to 1. The Guild members being more active on the Discord (eg. #guild-chat, #guild-bridge) and 2. us getting more members by users being interested in the guild and the carries


# Staff Changes
### Right now, the Staff Team is kind of a mess. Everyone does everything but not really good

## Changes
* Split the Staff / Admin Team into multiple different areas (eg. people specified for  Partner management, Staff Management (demotes and promotes staff. The admin team will still decide on who and when but this staff member will execute it and inform the user), (possibly) Carrier Management and Guild Staff). 
* Make a better staff spreadsheet. On my first days of being staff i didnt know what to do. Especially for the new trial staff this could be very helpful. Durations and Types of the punishment for a reason, things to do when someone breaks the rules etc. Yes this is common sense as a helper but it would still make things quite a lot easier. Instead of everyone doing what they think is right we would have an organized punishment log and could easily see what exactly they did wrong, how often etc.

# Donations

* People always ask me how they could get cosmetic X or how they could donate. We dont have anything like that right now. Get a good payment service (eg stripe, the ony that sbe uses). Then make up to 5 tiers that people could subscribe to / buy to unlock different types of cosmetics. Also make a better system for staff to add cosmetics or ranks to users.

# Overall

## Making a guild and a carry system will no longer make DG a "mod support" server and therefore allow us to apply for Discord Partner

## It would also make the Discord more active and give the Staff Team more things to do. 


## It would also make the Staff Team more organized with the sub categories
